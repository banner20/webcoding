 <div class="bodytext">In the world of web design today, the parallax effect has emerged as a captivating technique 
                       that adds a bit of magic to user experiences. In recent years, it has become really common 
                       in many places, although we often don't notice it unless we pay attention. It's become so 
                       popular that even students who are coding for the first time are creating websites with 
                       parallax as their first assignments. From websites to infographics and games, parallax is 
                       everywhere now, and there's a <strong>good</strong> reason for that.  
       </div>
       <h2> What is the Parallax Effect, Anyway?</h2>
       <div class="bodytext-two">Imagine looking out of a moving car's windowâ€”the objects nearby appear to rush by faster than those in the distance. That's the essence of the parallax effect! In web design, it's a clever trick that involves layers of content moving at different speeds as you scroll down a webpage.

      <div class="Headtext two">But, why should you care?</div>
   <div class="bodytext">The parallax effect isn't just about making things look cool <i>(though it definitely does!)</i>. It's a fantastic tool to grab your attention and guide you through a story. It's like flipping through the pages of a digital book, only 
    the images come to life and the scenes change as you scroll. This effect can instantly make a website more engaging and memorable.
